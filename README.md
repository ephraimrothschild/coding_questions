# Coding Questions
The purpose of this repository is to practice writing solutions for popular or interesting coding questions that are likely to appear on an interview.

I am pulling questions from places like Cracking The Coding Interview, CareerCup, and Glassdoor, as well as some interview questions I get from friends, or my own interviews.
